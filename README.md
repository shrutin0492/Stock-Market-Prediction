# Stock Market Prediction using Random Forest and Backtesting ðŸ“ˆ

This repository contains the code and resources for training a Random Forest model to predict stock market trends and making predictions using backtesting. The main focus is on predicting the movement of the S&P 500 index based on historical data. The implementation is provided in a Google Colab notebook named `market_prediction.ipynb`.

## Introduction

Stock market prediction is a challenging task that involves analyzing historical market data to forecast future trends. In this project, we use a Random Forest model to predict the movement of the S&P 500 index, one of the most widely followed equity indices. The goal is to create a predictive model that can assist investors in making informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is named `sp500.csv`, which is included in the [dataset](dataset/) directory of this repository. It contains historical data of the S&P 500 index, including features such as opening price, closing price, trading volume, etc. The dataset is used for both training the model and evaluating its performance.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Random Forest model for stock market prediction is provided in the [market_prediction.ipynb](market_prediction.ipynb) Google Colab notebook. The notebook covers the following steps:

1. Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset
2. Feature Selection and Engineering
3. Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
4. Training the Random Forest Model
5. Making Predictions using Backtesting
6. Evaluating Model Performance
7. Summary and Next Steps


The notebook includes detailed explanations and code comments through each step of the implementation process.

## Results

The results of the stock market prediction using the Random Forest model are presented in the notebook. We evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualize the predicted vs. actual price movements. The goal is to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data and whether it can provide meaningful insights into potential market trends.

## Usage

To use this codebase and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shrutin567/Stock-Market-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```bash
   cd Stock-Market-Prediction
   ```

3. Upload the `sp500.csv` dataset to your Google Colab environment or update the notebook with your dataset's path.

4. Open and run the `market_prediction.ipynb` notebook in a Google Colab environment. The notebook contains all the implementation details and steps.
